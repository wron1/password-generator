# password-generator

For this project I had to take a pre-existing html and css for a password generator and ensure that it functioned correctly. The user had to be asked the length of their password and then what type of characters they wanted to add. They were to choose out of lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special characters. Any combination they wanted at the length of their choosing between 8 to 128 characters long. The password also must include 1 of each chosen character type so the randomization isnt complete randomness to some extent.

The page is deployed live here: https://wron1.github.io/password-generator/
